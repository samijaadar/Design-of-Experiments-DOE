#Design_of_Experiments_DOE

Design of experiments (DOE) is defined as a branch of applied statistics that deals with planning, conducting, analyzing, and interpreting controlled tests to evaluate the factors that control the value of a parameter or group of parameters. DOE is a powerful data collection and analysis tool that can be used in a variety of experimental situations.

It allows for multiple input factors to be manipulated, determining their effect on a desired output (response). By manipulating multiple inputs at the same time, DOE can identify important interactions that may be missed when experimenting with one factor at a time. All possible combinations can be investigated (full factorial) or only a portion of the possible combinations (fractional factorial).

We Create a design matrix for the factors being investigated. The design matrix will show all possible combinations of high and low levels for each input factor.
These high and low levels can be coded as +1 and -1. For example, a 3 factor experiment will require 8 experimental runs.
